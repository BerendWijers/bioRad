# bioRad <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right">

bioRad aims to standardize methods for extracting and reporting biological signals from weather radars. It provides functionality to access low‚Äêlevel radar data, process these data into meaningful biological information on animal speeds and directions at different altitudes in the atmosphere, visualize these biological extractions, and calculate further summary statistics.

To get started, see:

* [Dokter et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04028): a paper describing the package.
* [bioRad vignette](https://adokter.github.io/bioRad/articles/bioRad.html): an introduction to bioRad's main functionalities.
* [Function reference](https://adokter.github.io/bioRad/reference/index.html): an overview of all bioRad functions.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bioRad from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bioRad")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
